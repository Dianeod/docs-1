# About this site


This site is the successor to the Mediawiki site. 

It reflects the work of the Kx community since 1993, has many authors, 
and continues to evolve.  



## :fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub

Truncated GitHub URLs are prefixed with the GitHub icon :fontawesome-brands-github: and omit the `https://github.com/` prefix. 

For example, read :fontawesome-brands-github: `KxSystems/kdb` as `https://github.com/KxSystems/kdb`.


## :fontawesome-regular-life-ring: Reference

The wiki’s Reference section, organised by glyphs, was a good tool for _reading_ q. It was easy to find, for example, all the possible meanings of `$`. On the other hand, a writer looking for tools to convert between datatypes and representations would have to explore most of the Reference section to be confident she had found them all. 

The new site reference has three aims:

- to be a _fast prompt_ for things already learned 
- to help _reading_ by showing what terms mean
- to help _writing_ by categorising the tools by semantic topic
