# NASA Frontier Development Lab - Disaster Prevention, Progress and Response (Floods)	 	
 	
The Frontier Development Lab (FDL) is a public private partnership run annually with both the European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The objective of FDL is to bring together researchers from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and space science sectors to tackle a broad spectrum of challenges in the space industry. The projects this year include challenges in lunar and heliophysics research, astronaut health and disaster prevention. This paper will focus on the Disaster Prevention, Progress and Response (Floods) challenge, for which Kx was a sponsor. 

## The need for AI in Disaster Prevention

Floods are the most destructive and dangerous natural disasters worldwide. All regions can be affected by flooding events and, with the increased variability in weather patterns due to global warming, this is likely to become even more prelevant <sup>[1]</sup>. The speed at which flooding events can occur, and difficulties in predicting their occurrance, create huge logistic problems for both governmental and non-governmental agencies. Over the past 10 years, floods have caused on average 95 deaths a year in the US alone, <sup>[2]</sup>, making them the deadliest weather related phenomenon <sup>[3]</sup>. Worldwide, floods cost in excess of 40 Billion dollars per year <sup>[4]</sup>, impacting property, agriculture and the health of individuals.
	 	 	
During the duration of the project, we collaborated with United States Geological Survey (USGS), a scientific agency within the US Department of the Interior. The objective of the organization is to study the landscape of the US and provide information about its natural resources and the natural hazards that affect them. Currently, hydrologists use physical models to help predict floods. These models require predictions to be carefully calibrated for each stream or watershed and careful consideration must be taken for dams, levees etc. Producing these models is extremely costly due to resource requirements. This limits the areas within the US that can avail of such systems to better prepare for flood events.

## The Challenge

To predict the flood susceptibility of a stream area, the project was separated into two distinct problems.

_Monthly Model_

Predicting, per month, if a stream height will reach a flood threshold or not. These flood thresholds were set by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and were location specific. Knowing which areas are susceptible to flooding, allow locations to better prepare for a flood event. 

_Time to Peak Model_

Predicting the time to peak of a flood event. When a major rain event occurs, knowing how long it will take for a river to reach its peak height is necessary in order to inform potentially affected individuals if and when they need to evacuate. This can help to reduce structural damage and loss of life during a disaster.

## The Data

This project focused on 6 states within the US, over a period of 10 years. Data was taken from ~800 gauge sites, between July 2009 and June 2019. Not all gauge sites had continuous historical data over the period, but all the available data for each site was used. 

The six states were:

-	`New Jersey`
-	`Nebraska`
-	`South Carolina`
-	`New York`
-	`South Dakota`
-	`Virginia`

A primary reason for choosing these states, was that each exhibits similar climate and landscape. Focusing on similar geographies helped to ensure that the models produced were precise.

Required datasets and providers:

_USGS_

USGS provided their Surface Water [dataset](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw). This consists of the height of a stream as measured by gauges for over 11,000 sites in the US. The data is updated every 15 minutes, with some locations having historical data for over 50 years. As previously mentioned, the data chosen in this case was a subset of these sites based on geographical location.


_PRISM_

[The PRISM Climate Group](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/) provides climate observations across the whole of the US. This data contains information on total precipitation, minimum/maximum temperature and dew point for each requested latitude and longitude. Spatial and climate datasets are then developed to reveal short and long-term climate patterns. This dataset was used to extract daily precipitation readings from the site locations for each day during the requested 10 year period. 

_National Land Cover Database (NLCD)_

The [NLCD database](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database) was collected using [Landsat](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/landsat/main/index.html). This satellite has a 30-meter resolution and provides information for the entire US. The Landsat satellite program is a NASA/USGS collaboration which provides the longest continuous space-based record of Earth's landscape <sup>[5]</sup>. Landsat's ground resolution and observation wavelengths allow the current use of land and its change over time to be detected and documented. This provides information such as land-use classification (urban, agriculture, forest, etc.), how well the land allows water to pass through it (impervious surface information) and tree cover. This dataset has updated records every 5 years from 2006. The granularity of this dataset is related to how quickly land use changes over time.

_National Hydrology Dataset Plus (NHDPlus)_

[NHDPlus](http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus/) is a geo-spatial hydrologic framework dataset associated with USGS, released in 2006. It is based off the NHD dataset, which provides information about the streams, rivers, canals, lakes and ponds throughout the US. The features used from this dataset were the catchment and drainage area characteristics at the stream site locations. Catchment areas are particularly important, as these are the areas of a river/stream in which water is collected and accumulates. This is vital information for predicting whether a flood is likely to occur or not. 


_Flooded Locations And Simulated Hydrographs Project (FLASH)_

[FLASH](https://blog.nssl.noaa.gov/flash/) is a database containing information about flood events within the US. The main goal of the FLASH project is to improve the accuracy and timing when predicting these flash floods. The information used from this dataset was the time taken for a river to reach its peak height after a major rain event.

_NOAA_

[NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) is a US governmental agency for monitoring and preserving the climate and environment. This dataset provided flood level thresholds for locations across the US. These thresholds consisted of four warning stages and the river height for a given location that causes them to reach these levels. The four warning stages were

Warning  |Meaning
---------|---------------
Action   | Mitigation action needs to be taken in order to prepare for possible hydrological activity.
Flood    | The river height poses a threat to lives, property and businesses.
Moderate | Some inundation of roads or buildings. A flood warning should be released.
Major    | Extensive inundation of roads and buildings. Considerable evacuations of areas may occur.


## Feature Engineering

Given the data available, it was possible to split the information into three datasets 

1. Ungauged basin: Information available at sites that do not contain stream gauge or future forecasting information. Data was limited to land use, past rainfall and upstream information.

2. Gauged basin: All information contained within the ungauged basin dataset, as well as stream gauge information. This included previous river heights and lagged/aggregated flooding information.

3. Perfect Forecasts: All information contained within the gauged basin dataset, as well as precipitation information around the time of the event.

To obtain these features, the `feat` function was used to extract previous information along with windowed features. This function takes the following parameters as input:

-	`x` table that is being updated
-	`y` how many values to calculate (integer list)
-	`z` column to apply the function to (symbol)
-	`col` new column name (symbol)
-	`d` dictionary of where, groupby and what type of functional statement is used
-	`fnc` function that is applied to the grouped columns

```q
q)colname:{enlist`$string[y],"_",string[x],"_",string[z]}
q)m_avg:{(max;(mavg;y;x))}
q)prv:{(xprev;y;x)}
q)func:{[x;y;z;b]raze{[x;y;z;b]colname[x;y;z]!enlist b[x;z]}[z;y;;b]each raze x}
q)feat:{[x;y;z;col;d;fnc] d[`w][x;d`wh;d`gr;$[1<count[z];raze;]func[y;col;;fnc]each z]}
```

To obtain the upstream values the `feat` function was used. The id number of each stream site consisted of over 8 digits. The first two digits were the grouping number of the river basin catchment. While the remaining digits were in ascending order based on the location of the gauge along the stream.

```q
q)catch_site:((';#);2;($:;`site_no))
q)site_date:`site_no`date!(catch_site;`date)
q)dict:`w`wh`gr!(!;();site_date)
q)upstr_ppt:feat[precip;1;`ppt;`upstr;dict;prv]
q)upstr_height:feat[maxht;1;`height;`upstr;dict;prv]
```

The `feat` function was also used to obtain previous values of both rainfall and stream gauge height readings before each date, for both the current location and sites upstream.

```q
q)dict[`gr]:site:(enlist `site_no)!enlist `site_no
q)prev_rain:feat[upstr_ppt;enlist 1_til 10;`ppt`upstr_ppt_1;`prev;sited:dict;prv]
q)all_height:feat[upstr_height;enlist 1_til 10;`height`upstr_height_1;`prev;dict;prv]
```
 
The above features were applicable to both aspects of this project. However, additional features that were problem specific were also added.

_Monthly Model_

When forecasts were provided for each model, it was important to have information on the average historical rainfall over different time windows. This feature was added to the dataset using the functions displayed below.

```q
q)dict[`gr]:(`date`site_no)!(($;enlist`month;`date);`site_no)
q)all_rain:feat[prev_rain;enlist 1_til 15;`ppt`upstr_ppt_1;`window;dict;m_avg]
```

_Time to Peak Model_

The hours before a flood event can provide important information on how quickly the stream gauge height is moving. This is incredibly useful to a model predicting how long it will take for the stream to reach its peak height. The information extracted at a given stream location, comprised of the maximum moving averages over different bucket sizes for the two days before the event. This was found using stream height data from USGS, which was updated at 15 minute intervals.

To make the times from the stream height dataset consistent with the FLASH dataset, the times were converted to be time zone agnostic.

These zones consist of 

1. EDT: Eastern Daylight Time
2. CDT: Central Daylight Time
3. EST: Eastern Standard Time

```q
q)time_zone:raze{dd:x[1];si:x[0];
          select `$first site_no,`$first unk from str where date=first dd,si=`$site_no}each 
          value each 0!select date by distinct site_no from all_peak_data;
q)peak_data:peak_data ij`site_no xkey time_zone
q)change_zone:{$[y=`EDT;x-04:00;y=`CDT;x-05:00;x-06:00]}
```

The features, along with information about the projected rainfall in the days following the event, were also extracted and joined onto the dataset

```q
q)range:{(within;x;(,;(+;(-:;2);y);y))}
q)wh:{(range[`date;x[1]];range[`datetime;x[2]];(=;x[0];($;enlist`;`site_no)))}
q)dict:{`w`wh`gr!(?;wh x;0b)}
q)wind_ht_prev:{feat[str;enlist 2 4 12 48;`height;`wind_prev;dict x;m_avg]}each 
               flip peak_data[`site_no`date`start_time]

q)wh:{((within;`date;(,;y[1];(+;y[1];x)));(=;y[0];`site_no))}
q)dict:{`w`wh`gr!(?;wh[x;y];0b)}
q)rain_pred:{feat[all_rain;enlist 1_til x;`ppt`upstr_ppt_1;`fut_window;dict[x;y];m_avg]}[3]
          each flip peak_data[`site_no`date]
```

## Target Data

_Monthly Model_

The target data used in this case was the Flood level warning, extracted from the NOAA dataset.

The latitude and longitude of these provided thresholds did not exactly match the stream gauge locations. As such, the latitudes and longitudes of both the stream locations and NOAA threshold readings were joined using a k-dimensional tree (kd-tree) nearest neighbours algorithm. This algorithm is explained in Appendix 1 at the end of this paper. 

The code used to achieve this nearest neighbours calculation is seen below, with the algorithm implementation contained in full in the github repository associated with this paper. 

```q
q)wlatl:raze each warning[`Latitude`Longitude],'gauges[`dec_lat_va`dec_long_v]
q)tabw:kd.buildtree[wlatl;2]
q)gauge_val:count[warning]+til count gauges
q)nnwarn:kd.nns[;tabw;(count[warning]#0),count[gauges]#1;flip wlatl;`edist]each gauge_val

q)joins:([site_no:gauges`site_no]nn:nnwarn[;0];ndw:nnwarn[;1])
q)floodlvl:(maxht ij joins)lj`nn xkey warning
```

This dataset was then joined onto the stream gauge data, adding columns counting the number of times a given stream gauge reached each warning level per month. 

For the sake of this project, we only wanted to focus on the "Flood" stage. This level was chosen in an attempt to achieve a more balanced dataset while still predicting a meaningful target. Choosing either of the more severe levels would result in a very low number of targets making it more difficult to discern events of interest.  Our target data was a binary label denoting whether the flood warning level was reached in a given month. Any site that claimed to flood more than 28 days per month were omitted from the dataset as we only wanted to focus on events that occured infrequently and were more difficult to predict.

```q
q)threshold:0!select first Action,first Flood,first Moderate,first Major,no_Action:
	   count where height>Action,no_Flood:count where height>Flood,
	   no_Mod:count where height>Moderate,no_Major:count where 
	   height>Major by site_no,"m"$date from floodlvl;
q)threshold:select from threshold where no_Flood<28;
q)threshold[`target]:threshold[`no_Flood]>0
q)threshold
site_no  date    Action Moderate Major target ...

01200000 2010.06 6      10       12    0    
...
```

_Time to Peak Model_

The FLASH dataset was then used for the time to peak model, which highlights how long it will take a stream gauge location to reach its peak height after the rain event. 

Only dates within the 10 year period and site numbers within the 6 states mentioned were included. The target data was calculated by subtracting the start-time (denoted by the start of a major rainfall event at the location) from the time that the peak height was found to occur. 

This was then converted into a binary classification problem by setting a threshold for a 'flash flood' at 3.5 hours after the major rainfall event. Any time above this was set to `0b` and less than this time was `1b`. This threshold was chosen after discussions with hydrologists, who found this to be a reasonable split in the dataset.

```q
q)peak[`delta_peak]:(peak[`peak_time]-peak[`start_time])*24
q)peak[`target]:peak[`delta_peak]<3.5
```


## Spatial and temporal joins

_Monthly Model_

After joining the stream height and precipitation tables from USGS and PRISM, the dataset was then broken up into monthly values. By taking the first day of each month at a site, it was possible to obtain the maximum moving averages of precipitation for different window sizes for a given month, along with the precipitation and height values for the last few days of the month prior. This data was then joined to the `stream_char` dataset, which consisted of the basin and landcover characteristcs, and the “threshold” dataset, based on month and site number.

Lagged features were then added to this dataset, which included information such as whether a flood occurred in the month or year prior.

```q
q)all_monthly_data:window_feat[all_monthly_data;enlist 1 12;`target;();site_d;`lagged;!]
q)tgts:0!select site_no,no_Flood,date,cs:count date by site_no from all_monthly_data
q)all_monthly_data[`lagged_target_all]:raze{count[x]mavg raze x}each?[tgts;();();`no_Flood]
```

_Time to Peak Model_

The daily rain and height, FLASH, and the `stream_char` were then joined based on site number and date to create the time to peak dataset.

## Train and Test Split

A dictionary was created for each of the three separate datasets:

1. Ungauged
2. Gauged
3. Perfect Forecasts

The dictionary contained the different feature columns required to make up the above datasets for each of the monthly (`M`) and time to peak (`P`) models.

```q
q)fnd_col:{x where x in y}
q)ungauged_noforecast_basinM:fnd_col[ungauged_noforecast_basin;cols cleaned_monthly]
q)gauged_basinM:             fnd_col[gauged_basin;cols cleaned_monthly]
q)perfect_forecastM:         fnd_col[perfect_forecast;cols cleaned_monthly]
q)ungauged_noforecast_basinP:fnd_col[ungauged_noforecast_basin;cols cleaned_peak]
q)gauged_basinP:             fnd_col[gauged_basin;cols cleaned_peak]
q)perfect_forecastP:         fnd_col[perfect_forecast;cols cleaned_peak]
q)
q)ungauge: `M`P!(ungauged_noforecast_basinM;ungauged_noforecast_basinP)
q)gauge:   `M`P!(ungauge[`M],gauged_basinM;ungauge[`P],gauged_basinP)
q)show forecast:`M`P!(gauge[`M],perfect_forecastM;gauge[`P],perfect_forecastP)
M| `month`cos_t`sin_t`elv`imp`CatAreaSqKm`WsAreaSqKm`CatAreaSqKmRp100`WsAreaS..
P| `month`cos_t`sin_t`elv`imp`CatAreaSqKm`WsAreaSqKm`CatAreaSqKmRp100`WsAreaS..
```

These dictionaries were then used to extract the appropriate columns from each table, to make them suitable inputs to machine learning models. This was achieved by using the `split_dict` function which takes a table as input, as well as `M` or `P` indicating which model was being used.

```q
q)split_dict:{(!). flip(
   (`ungauged;flip x[ungauge[y]]);
   (`gauged;flip x[gauge[y]]);
   (`forecast;flip x[forecast[y]]))}
q)split_dict[all_monthly_data;`M]
ungauged| 7i  -0.959493  -0.2817326    456f 1.454468 0.7407  526.9086 0.1926 ..
gauged  | 7i  -0.959493  -0.2817326    456f 1.454468 0.7407  526.9086 0.1926 ..

```
The function returned a dictionary containing the matrix for each of the ungauged, gauged and perfect forecast datasets.

```q

..
```

_Monthly Model_

When splitting the data for this model, it was deemed important that no time leakage occurred between the training and test sets (e.g. the training set contained information from 2009 to 2017, while the test set contained the remaining years). This ensured that the model was being tested in a way that was similar to a real-world deployment. A split was chosen so that 20 percent of the data for each site was in the test set.

```q
q)cutoff:update cutoff:min[date]+floor 0.8*max[date]-min[date]by site_no from cleaned_monthly
q)XtrainMi:select from cutoff where date<cutoff
q)ytrainM:exec target from cutoff where date<cutoff
q)XtestMi:select from cutoff where date>=cutoff
q)ytestM:exec target from cutoff where date>=cutoff
q)XtrainM:split_dict[XtrainMi;`M]
q)XtestM:split_dict[XtestMi;`M]
```

_Time to Peak Model_

The time to peak data was separated so that sites did not appear in both the train and test dataset. This was done to ensure that the models being produced could be generalized to new locations. The target data was binned into a histogram as below and the train test split completed such that the distribution of targets in the training and testing sets were stratified.

```q
q)sites:0!select sum target by site_no from cleaned_peak
q)plt[`:hist][sites`target];
q)plt[`:show][];
```

## Building Models
	 	 	
For both problems a variety of models were tested, but for the sake of this paper, models and results from an eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and random forest classifier are presented below. These models were chosen due to their ability to deal with complex, imbalanced datasets. With this type of dataset, overfitting is a common feature. Overfitting occurs when the model fits too well to the training set, capturing a lot of the noise from the data. This leads to the model preforming successfully in training, while not succeeding as well on the testing or validation sets. Another problem that can occur, is that a naive model can be produced, always predicting that a flood will not occur. This leads to high acccuracy but not meaningful results. As seen below in the results section, XGBoost and random forest models were able to deal better with these issues by tuning their respective hyper-parameters. A more detailed description of these models can be found in Appendix 2.

To visualize the results, a precision-recall curve was used, illustrating the trade off between the positive predictive value and the true positive rate over a variety of probability thresholds <sup> [7]</sup>. This is a good metric to measure the success of a model when the classes are unbalanced, compared with similar graphs such as the ROC curve. Precision and recall were also used because getting a balance between these metrics when predicting floods, was vital to ensure that all floods were given warnings. Yet also to ensure that a low number of false positives were given, the penalty for which was that warnings would be ignored.  

A function named `pr_curve` was created to output the desired results from the models. This function outputs the accuracy of prediction, the meanclass accuracy, a classification report highlighting the precision and recall per class, along with a precision-recall curve. This function also returned the prediction at each location in time for the models used, this can be seen later in this paper to create a map of flooding locations.

The inputs to the `pr_curve` function are:

-	`Xtest` (matrix of feature values)
-	`ytest` (list of targets)
-	`dictionary of models that are being used`


The dictionary of models consisted of XGBoost and a random forest model, with varying hyper-parameters for each model.

The monthly model obtained the highest accuracy scores using random forests, while the time to peak model performed best for XGBoost. In both cases, random forests achieved high precision scores and low recall results. Meanwhile, XGBoost gave a slightly more balanced precision/recall result.

In the above case, the XGBoost classifier achieved the hightest accuracy score in both models. Once again, XGBoost also gave a more balanced precision/recall score for both models.

### Feature Significance

There is also a lot to be learned from determining which features contribute to predicting the target for a model. To do this, the function ```ml.fresh.significantfeatures``` was applied to the data, to return the statistically significant features based on a p-value. Combining this with ```ml.fresh.ksigfeat[x]``` enabled the top x most significant features to be extracted from each dataset. 

_Monthly Model_

```q
q)title:{"The top 15 significant features for the ",x," predicts are:"}
q)title["monthly"]
q)string .ml.fresh.significantfeatures[flip forecast[`M]!cleaned_monthly[forecast[`M]];
  cleaned_monthly`target;.ml.fresh.ksigfeat 15]

"The top 15 significant features for the monthly predicts are:"

"lagged_target_all"
"window_ppt_1"
"window_ppt_2"
"window_ppt_3"
"window_ppt_4"
"window_ppt_5"
"window_ppt_6"

```
_Time To Peak Model_

```q
q)title["time-peak"]
q)string .ml.fresh.significantfeatures[flip forecast[`P]!cleaned_peak[forecast[`P]];

"The top 15 significant features for the time-peak predicts are:"

"WsAreaSqKmRp100"
"WsAreaSqKm"

```

### Graphics

_Monthly Model_

Using these results, it was also possible to build a map highlighting which areas are at risk of flooding each month. This could be used by governmental bodies to prioritize funding in the coming weeks.

```q
q)preds:last pltP1`model
q)newtst:update preds:preds from XtestMi
q)newt:select from newtst where date within 2018.01 2018.12m,preds=1

```

_Time to Peak Model_ 

Data relating to the peak height of a stream from an actual flooding event, was compared with the upper bound peak time from our model.

```q

## Conclusion

From the above results we could predict, with relatively high accuracy, whether an area was likely to flood or not in the next month. We could also produce a model to predict if a stream would reach its peak height within 3.5 hours.

For the monthly models, the future weather predictions played an important role in predicting whether an area would flood or not. Accuracy, recall and precision all increased as the weather predictions and gauged information columns were added to the dataset. This corresponded with the results from the significant feature tests, with lagged_target information and also the windowed rain values of the current month being the most important features to include. 

The opposite was true for the time-peak values, as previous rain and stream gauge information along with the basin characteristics were seen to be the most significant features when predicting these values. Including additional information about the future predicted rainfall decreased the accuracy of the results, with the best results being obtained from the model with only past rainfall and basin and soil characteristics being fed into the model.

Both of these results might have been physically expected. In the case of the monthly prediction, information regarding future forecast is pivotal in whether an area will flood in the next month. Whereas in the case of a time to peak value, it would be unlikely that information about rainfall in the next number of days would add to the predictive power of a model.

Knowing which features contribute to flood susceptibility, and the length of time taken for a river to reach its peak height, are important pieces of information to extract from the model. From this, organizations such as USGS can better prepare for flood events and understand how changing climates and placement of impervious surface can affect the likelihood of flooding.

The best results from the models above were obtained by continuously adjusting the hyper-parameters of the model. The unbalanced target data in the monthly model, meant that weighting the classes was an important feature to experiment with. This was particularly important when trying to obtain high precision and recall results. Between the two models, balance in the recall and precision was better for the XGBoost model.

## Appendix:1

Kd-tree

A kd-tree is used in k-dimensional space to create a tree structure. In the tree each node represents a hyperplane which divides the space into two seperate parts (the left and the right branch) based on a given direction. This direction is associated with a certain axis dimension, with the hyperplane perpendicular to the axis dimension. What is to the left or right of the hyperplane is determined by whether each data point being added to the tree is greater or less than the node value at the splitting dimension. For example, if the splitting dimension of the node is `x`, all data points with a smaller `x` value than the value at the splitting dimension node will be to the left of the hyperplane, while all points equal to or greater than will be in the right subplane.

The tree is used to efficiently find a datapoint's nearest neighbour, by potentially eleminating a large portion of the dataset using the kd-trees properties. This is done by starting at the root and moving down the tree recursively, calculating the distance between each node and the datapoint in question, allowing branches of the dataset to be eliminated based on whether this node-point distance is less than or greater than the curent nearest neighbour distance. This enables rapid look ups for each point in a dataset.

Ensemble Methods

An ensemble learning algorithm combines multiple outputs from a wide variety of predictors to achieve improved results. A combination of "weak" learners are typically used with the objective to achieve a "strong" learner. A weak predictor is a classifier that is only slightly correlated to the true predictions, while a strong learner is highly correlated. One of the advantages of using ensemble methods is that overfitting is reduced by diversifying the set of predictors used and averaging the outcome, lowering the variance in the model. 

XGBoost

XGBoost, commended for its speed and performance, is an ensemble method built on a gradient boosting framework of decision trees. This method utilises boosting techniques by building the model sequentially, using the results from the previous step to improve the next. This method relies on subsequent classifiers to learn from the mistakes of the previous classifier. 


Random Forests

Random Forests are an ensemble learning method, where classifiers are trained independently using a randomized subsample of the data. This randomness reduces overfitting, while making the model more robust than if just a single decision tree was used. To obtain the output of the model, the decisions of multiple trees are merged together, represented by the average.
